<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>I am starting my jouney in web development, and will keep posting my progress from scratch.<br>
We often want to practice all we learn but it is seen that all projects need CSS and Javascript, which is true but we can still practice at our pace by making random projects from whatever we have learned. <b>It may not be perfect but its progress.</b></p>
<p>This is a small form to practice HTML skills, (just HTML). As, I said, its small, and for practice.</p>

<center><i>Keep practicing, keep progressing!!</i></center>
